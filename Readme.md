# Rohit Bahuguna - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Rohit. Passionate and driven, I am on track to completing my  Engineering degree. I have developed a strong foundation in Technology and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I have always been captivated by patterns and the stories hidden within data. From my childhood days of deciphering cloud shapes to my academic journey culminating in a degree in engineering, my fascination with numerical & statistical calculation has evolved into a deep-seated passion for data analysis.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data. I developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends and engaging in diverse projects such as Instagram user analytics, hiring analytics, Medical Data visualizer, Sea Level Predictor, etc. I honed my expertise in extracting insights from complex datasets using tools like Javascript, Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Tableau, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Seaborn. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time and always look for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Beyond data, I seek solace in activities like reading books and drawing. I believe that success comes with balance, and these activities allow me to step back, relax, and return to my work with a clear mind and fresh perspective.

I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Online Retail Application Database
**Code:** [Online Retail Application Database.sql](https://github.com/rohitb1406/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Online%20Retail%20Application%20database)

**Goal:** To design a database system for an e-commerce application.

**Description:** The project's primary goal was to establish a database for online retail applications. Using SQL queries, we developed tables for customers, products, orders, and order items to store retail data. The project encompassed tasks such as database creation, insertion of various table values, and deletion of unnecessary data through DDL, DML, and DCL commands. This enabled us to design databases and create schemas.

**Skills:** SQL Querying, Database Design, and Data Manipulation.

**Technology:** SQL Workbench.

### International Debt Analysis
**Goal:** To draw insights from the international debt dataset.

[**Insights**](https://github.com/rohitb1406/SQL-Projects/tree/main/International%20Debt)

**Description:** In this project, we have analyzed the international debt data collected by the World Bank using SQL in SQL Workbench. The dataset encompasses information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories. Our objective is to derive meaningful insights from this data by answering key questions related to total debt, debt distribution among countries, and average debt across different indicators.


**Skills:** Data Loading, SQL Querying, Database Design, and Exploratory Data Analysis.

**Technology:** SQL Workbench


### Demographic Data Analyzer

**Goal:** The designed project aims to analyze demographic data from a dataset.

[**Code Link**](https://github.com/rohitb1406/Python-Project/blob/main/boilerplate-demographic-data-analyzer-2/README.md)

**Description:** The Demographic Data Analyzer is a Python project designed to analyze demographic data from a dataset. It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The project aims to answer various questions about the demographic characteristics of individuals, such as race distribution, average age, educational attainment, and income level.

**Skills:** Python, Pandas, and data analysis.

**Technology:** Visual Studio Code.

### Airbnb Listing 2016 Tableau Dashboard
[**Dashboard Link**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rohit.bahuguna/viz/Airbnb_Listing_2016/Dashboard1)

**Description:**  Ingested this data in MySQL database and performed ETL to remove outliers, clean up bad records, and normalize prices to a standard format.
I used Tableau to build various BI dashboards that show price growth in different hotels based on region and demography, and how peopleâ€™s preferences have changed throughout 2016.

**Skills:** Data wrangling, Data analysis, Data visualization.

**Technology:** Tableau Public
