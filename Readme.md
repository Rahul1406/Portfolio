# Rohit Bahuguna - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Rohit. Passionate and driven, I am on track to completing my  Engineering degree. I have developed a strong foundation in Technology and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I have always been captivated by patterns and the stories hidden within data. From my childhood days of deciphering cloud shapes to my academic journey culminating in a degree in engineering, my fascination with numerical & statistical calculation has evolved into a deep-seated passion for data analysis.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data. I developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends and engaging in diverse projects such as Instagram user analytics, hiring analytics, Medical Data visualizer, Sea Level Predictor, etc. I honed my expertise in extracting insights from complex datasets using tools like Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Tableau, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Seaborn. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time and always look for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Beyond data, I seek solace in activities like reading books and drawing. I believe that success comes with balance, and these activities allow me to step back, relax, and return to my work with a clear mind and fresh perspective.

I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

My CV is in [pdf](https://github.com/rohitb1406/Portfolio/edit/main/Readme.md).

This repository showcases skills, shares projects, and tracks my progress in Data Analytics / Data science-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Online Retail Application Database
**Code:** [Online Retail Application Database.sql](https://github.com/rohitb1406/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Online%20Retail%20Application%20database)

**Goal:** To design a database system for an e-commerce application.

**Description:** The project's primary goal was to establish a database for online retail applications. Using SQL queries, we developed tables for customers, products, orders, and order items to store retail data. The project encompassed tasks such as database creation, insertion of various table values, and deletion of unnecessary data through DDL, DML, and DCL commands. This enabled us to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), examining correlations between orders Vs customer relations and order vs. product relations.

**Skills:** SQL Querying, Database Design, Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

**Technology:** SQL Workbench.

### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
**Code:** [`Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql`](https://github.com/Rahul1406/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Project%20Queries_%20Nashville%20Housing.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.


**Skills:** DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** SQL Server


### Legendary Pokémon Analysis

**Goal:** To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

**Code:** [`Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)`](https://github.com/Rahul1406/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Legendary%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of  Pokémon.  The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type, and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), and analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Tidyverse 

### Airbnb Listing 2016 Tableau Dashboard
[**Dashboard Link**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rohit.bahuguna/viz/Airbnb_Listing_2016/Dashboard1)

**Description:**  Ingested this data in MySQL database and performed ETL to remove outliers, clean up bad records, and normalize prices to a standard format.
I used Tableau to build various BI dashboards that show price growth in different hotels based on region and demography, and how people’s preferences have changed throughout 2016.

**Skills:** Data wrangling, Data analysis, Data visualization.

**Technology:** Tableau Public
