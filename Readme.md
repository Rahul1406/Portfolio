# Rohit Bahuguna - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Rohit. Passionate and driven, I am on track to completing my degree in Electronics and Communication (B. Tech). I have developed a strong foundation in Technology and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I have always been captivated by patterns and the stories hidden within data. From my childhood days of deciphering cloud shapes to my academic journey culminating in a degree in engineering, my fascination with numerical & statistical calculation has evolved into a deep-seated passion for data analysis.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends and engaging in diverse projects such as Instagram user analytics, hiring analytics, Medical Data visualizer, Sea Level Predictor, and many more. I honed my expertise in extracting insights from complex datasets using tools like Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Tableau, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy and Seaborn. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems

Beyond data, I seek solace in activities like reading books and drawing. I believe that success comes with balance, and these activities allow me to step back, relax, and return to my work with a clear mind and fresh perspective.

I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
**Code:** [`Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`](https://github.com/Rahul1406/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.



### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
**Code:** [`Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql`](https://github.com/Rahul1406/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Project%20Queries_%20Nashville%20Housing.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.


**Skills:** DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** SQL Server


### Legendary Pokémon Analysis

**Goal:** To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

**Code:** [`Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)`](https://github.com/Rahul1406/Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Legendary%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of  Pokémon.  The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Tidyverse
