## Rohit Bahuguna - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Rohit. Passionate and driven, I am on track to completing my degree in Electronics and Communication (B. Tech). I have developed a strong foundation in Technology and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I have always been captivated by patterns and the stories hidden within data. From my childhood days of deciphering cloud shapes to my academic journey culminating in a degree in engineering, my fascination with numerical & statistical calculation has evolved into a deep-seated passion for data analysis.
During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends and engaging in diverse projects such as Instagram user analytics, hiring analytics, Medical Data visualizer, and Sea Level Predictor. I honed my expertise in extracting insights from complex datasets using tools like Advance Excel, Python, SQL, Microsoft Excel, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib and Seaborn. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.
I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems
Beyond data, I seek solace in activities like reading books and drawing. I believe that success comes with balance, and these activities allow me to step back, relax, and return to my work with a clear mind and fresh perspective.
I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.
